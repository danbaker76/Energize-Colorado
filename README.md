# Energize-Colorado

These are the working jupyter notebooks I am putting together in Python for Energize Colorado.

The first one is an application that scrapes business information for minority owned businesses in Colorado.

In addition to what I am working with for Energize Colorado, I've done some digging into the California Secretary of State API that was created in 2018.  This will be used to cross reference businesses that are being affected by the pandemic in 5 specific cities (Compton, Stockton, Chulu Vista, Fresno & San Jose)
